First task is

Perform analysis on three lipids from the positive 

data set and then if using the reduced  dataset, use the

provided lipids and the

provided conditions.

 OK, so OK. So I've come to a dialog box on screen about lipid 

name, lipid formula, adduct type

type i'm going to look at the

caf6ec04-bf6f-4bfd-9ad3-497ffe018491

drop down. With that there's there's protonated ammonium adduct

ac479056-a482-46c8-80c0-bd9dd50ce095

 sodium addict potassium adduct. 

Further, for the future, maybe

there may be other adducts that

ea57a00e-a079-4b34-b3cb-0a9583d50676

you might we might want to add

in positive, but then they are

the major ones. I would argue for positive ion. Isotope depth, 

ab38ba64-e3eb-4cee-89e3-c467ade1696b

not quite sure what that is. Retention time tolerance, mass to charge

charge, PPM tolerance there remove lipid. So do I just

need to know now presumably just need to type in or to

deb3f51e-01a1-4b1e-985b-ef8f3c5ee362

extract lipid name from the file

you provided. Yep.

bd539090-19ca-4398-ae2a-341919041eac

So I can just type one in.

Yep. OK.

OK, let's see how that works.

b2364232-5dae-4132-91a3-e488f45d3087

Although maybe I'll do an

d1fcbec8-544c-4f4f-8a79-1b562bb415c3

abbreviation, Say 34:1. See what happens there? OK

liquid formula off the top my

head. I don't know it.

 If you go into their conditions file. 
 
 
 
 My apologies, OK, right? 

a1c20efc-c1d9-4b45-8685-7ee87a0cdf81

That's fine. That's no

problem. OK, sorry.

 That was a good one. Wasn't it OK. 

def6d49b-b87d-45fc-b645-7e10e5e9ca89

Again, just in terms of

notification, it would be

useful just to say to to use

is what, what notation you

want the lipid name. Some

people might put in a full

name, for example ...

 Again depends on notation, so it's 

 it's quite a nice thing to have OK adduct type M+H

af4bfce7-c955-407c-b0f6-d60584820400

 isotope depth, okay I have all the conditions here. My apologies 

 alright, that's all straightforward enough. 

 Type that in six, retention time 660, so we've done it in terms 

of seconds. OK, that's fine.

Often often work in minutes

aff6c763-0c02-40d4-8ca6-97a306039b29

myself, but that's fine. You

know it's easy enough to divide

bd61076c-06d2-4239-954f-e4e5b0922663

by 60 became, so got an accurate

mass tolerance should be five.

OK. Then add lipid presumably.

OK, just put these OK. Just put all these in. OK so 

aa2549c7-4230-4503-afef-41f8d0b5ab44

I'll just put time. Now I'm

just putting in the remaining

e10a6ab9-c24d-41cf-8c8a-4a781891dc95

lipids that have been chosen,

or at least provided in the

condition. So again lipid

formula. I'll just copy that.

 Again that's an M+H

Isotope okay that's easy enough 6.

cfee3a23-7b54-4623-abb2-d32bc6434e9b

 retention Time is 600 in this 

 case.

 Tolerance is 20. Did I mess that up?

 The mass again, tolerance was PPM, so again, 

it's nice. You got tolerance

both PPM in Dalton. I generally

d5ce44be-e99f-407e-8fa9-d716eacffb63

work in PPM, but I know some

people [refer dalton] and OK and

c3565dc9-3bb6-4cac-a628-66a97f108e89

I'll. Add a third lipid.

dbba92a5-dc42-4e78-bd55-21c895367691

So again, lipid name again from

the conditions provided 36.

eb186d09-06ab-454e-9015-281853ff0f15

Lipid formula will copy that.

f677f708-79a9-4d74-ae7e-174035ab29dc

 Make a straightforward enough and M plus H again isotope depth

this 6. Retention time on this

badf5eea-5179-4864-aa1c-2ee35b27a138

occasion 638. Tolerance

again 20 so OK

and then PPM.

c2712e17-95e2-4389-8b96-88d4905000ff

Five OK, and then I'll

presumably now I've got my

d0b57640-a931-4c40-a426-ed9e81a7fee4

three lipids in positive. I'm

just gonna go back and double

 check them all. OK charge mode there so it's clear 

 their lipid name, Formula, adduct. Okay isotope 

 depth, retension time mass tolerance and mass charge 

 and its tolerance. accurate mass another 34:1 34:2. OK, I 

 isotope depth I've entered the wrong values so that would help 6 

e5ae4183-c885-4ed4-8112-4d713413c843

retention time 600 tolerance should be 

 20, is that right? Yeah, OK, that's fine, and I don't know why I've got 34 in

 there. OK, that's OK. Isotope depth. Something seems to be changing when I'm putting

 stuff in there, so I'm not quite sure what's

eef3b510-723d-4271-8751-102249e33ab4

 happening there when I'm changing those conditions. So 

I'm putting numbers in and this

number seems to be changing so

that what that is. But but

maybe, just maybe, do being

doing something silly again.

Likewise, that seems to do the

c852eaca-ecff-4d86-b093-51e42ed2f1c2

same in terms of isotope depth.

If I go up.

Can I just do that? that seems fineso I need to use it if I go

that down. Six retention time

can needs to be.

a5a3282b-a6f2-4f9b-9557-879673f97dae

 600 and a tolerance of 20

 OK 660. Yeah, that's fine. I'll go next. 

 Pick files and enter and add files, presuming that 

I'll just need to go and add

files from the files that

a5bbc911-661c-4549-b84a-45a740cb8b76

being provided from the folder I have got. So if I go

db1b6727-5256-402d-a79c-39cae11e2428

to my desktop and I've got

positive evaluation, so I'm

ca811c0c-5719-4e9a-b879-f04ff3a94ad5

assuming that I had all of

these files, so I wonder if

I can select more, so that's

why I'm going to try and do.

OK, and then I got out the

files. Cancel don't need

to do that. OK, right? And we

c0a81b64-9b8e-4045-98f6-b7eea48fe9fa

got here. Pick files into times.

OK, so I'm slightly not quite

sure what I need to do here. So

in terms of picking times.

So I'm not, I'm yeah OK.

bd24420f-28fd-427b-86a4-57aaaa6d0f60

So I did my files, pick files

and enter times. Start

lookign in the conditions. If

I can find anything in terms

of entering times doesn't seem

to be. I don't have entry

times means the time that I

just give it a value or just

see what happens there.

What does that refer to

retention time?

Look

a058cc2b-0879-48d6-bc60-4b9aa2372829

OK, so I've now filled in those

times. In fact, maybe why

didn't? Why did I call them?

Actually, I know what I'll

bf32da58-05c8-460d-b989-b4f60bd3b28e

do is. I'll call him the time

points for the experiments of

the experiment so well say nought, 8.

fdd3e60c-fc1e-49f8-800c-68b5315bcfc3

ab8c3d43-d23d-4e20-b1c1-3d614626dff7

48, 72, 96 We'll just see how we go with that. So I've

filled in those boxes. I'm not

sure if I've filled them in correctly, but I have

filled them in so I'll go to

next and we'll see where we go.

OK, review analysis details

lipids, files Okay . So that previous. So if I

go back yeah OK what we really

c8fbf12f-94d1-4817-8162-0e096b9c9769

for me be really handy is again

just to give an indication as to

c4a61546-5b11-4559-8f5c-de735335f26b

the time points. Again as someone whos not a bioinformatics specialist.

and not necessarily good with softwarethat would be really

good just to offer some some

guides there to make it very

a02b0661-f970-4cef-9907-11ce895eb420

clear for people who are not as

experts is maybe other users. So

go to next, Ilike the feature

I can go back. That's really

good and review things.

OK, got the files. OK I've got

review analysis details and

fbcf1fe1-fd80-4f04-a748-21de430a45c7

lipids. Yeah OK, that's fine.

It seems to be seems to be some

cba13561-c461-4723-843a-5784cd15e8ea

slight changes here in terms of

mass tolerance. Not quite sure

cf73f297-5815-4423-830d-a08e41b61c6e

why that is and again some

retention times that if I've

done something strange. But

let's start the analysis

anyway. We can always go back

and have a play. Start the

analysis so performing

analysis.

d22dd3bd-7a41-4132-8731-96fa448ea8fd

Different time points, so this

is the first PC 34 one. Now this

is the second PC 34:2.

d7715379-91fb-4f0a-9778-4c44cdb0282d

PC-36. Two

to the third lipid again.

d99b1e94-41f3-4b1d-88a4-b5797b0f5b15
Again three lipids

chosen from positive ion.

f226f816-890e-49fe-a88c-c24b4b132885

OK just waiting for this analysis to complete.

b4c98d54-1a2a-40eb-adf4-b0e9f371c4eb

<BUG IDENTIFICATION>



And so the next one is define any three negative lipids and

export them? And by exporting

them, I mean you should export

them so that you should export

the run so that you can import

fd8de7d9-2797-4652-815d-08a19ffa392a

them again later.

eba28892-3f27-4023-ad55-0005579bbb32

Export them if that if that

makes sense. So you should

d5eb8c32-a70c-4d7f-b68b-0cb941371cb9

export the lipids so that you

can import the lipids back

into the application later.

c393382a-1f80-4838-b792-e29587b02de6

From the files OK from OK.

Right test file negative.



OK, I'm gonna I'm OK. So if I

don't need to use that box and

I'm not, I won't. OK so I'm not

quite sure as to the task in

terms of I can extract the ions

from the from the raw files or

a4420af6-db5f-4618-a562-bb6c8f8183d2

if you have the. In this case

we've got the mzxml

or MZML files so I can. I

can try and open those and I can

look for the accurate masses of

these particular PCs.




I'll give you a little bit

of assistance here. I am, so

the first thing you

need to do is enter the lipids

ab00f87a-2484-4429-9c1b-ec6e77cc366c

as you did before. OK, first

thing you need to do is enter

enter the negative ones. OK, I'll

let you see if you can figure

out what to do after

that. Let's just do that then so

I'll do all three. So this is

this is negative. ion now just.

f285d622-2d3a-479c-a945-1289b9a3ca7e

Completing the details as per

the so again that's different.

If an adduct and M minus formate

M plus formate even ice to

cb0e4fdd-c4f2-4fa8-9b28-c66c88fe35ac

depth should be 2.

Retention time is 586.

b74874c0-93a9-442a-9cdd-255609508efd

Tolerance is 20.

a906a9eb-0d40-43b1-beeb-5b5dc0ec804b

Mass we've already got, PPM

should be 5

ec698792-950d-42d1-b9e1-55423466a5f3

And I had a lipid.

b813e005-dba6-4376-9135-14f2561e8107

And this is PC 36:1.

a02ba6ab-adac-4bd6-a440-1bb9600a6812

Lipid formula, I'll

just copy it.

b99f4d25-1e04-4653-b980-b53410504b3a

Okay isotope depth is 4

retention time is 680. Sorry not

talking enough so I'm just

ac498115-ce29-4f1e-8708-52e37083de9b

completing the. The important

information and putting that in

f0b09afb-c37e-4c80-ba39-0593dfdc4d9c

at 5 PPM.

And he's got a third lipid

negative ion lipid. Name will be

PC 37 one.

c47920de-a37c-4ec8-b362-ed591d747c8d

Lipid formula is that

b527f3c2-42db-425e-bc0e-21c4d9353356

OK M - H thats fine. isotope depth is three

f772ac90-01fa-472d-8b82-5f55f8b766d1

retention time is 654

tolerance is, 20 mass to charge

tolerances 5 again as with

positive, I'm just going to

check the data and make sure

it's inputted correctly. 
Isotope depth is five.

That's fine.

That's four, six, 18,20 that's all

very good. That's 36:1 ninety

five and then P 37 one.

M-H, tolerance, 3654

twenty. You know. Just making

sure. OK, that's

fine. So I'm going to next.

OK, so pick files and enter

times again. So again, if I add

files again from negative ion on

d1c148cc-f69f-4cd6-be78-820492633928

this occasion, so I'm just going

to Add all of those files.

c9bfc14d-ea4d-4d94-9d26-87f66548d151

Again, I will use the different

time points for the data

be9899f2-836a-4548-b82b-6aad414fc8ec

collection, so that looks like

it's against its in terms of

hours of labeling nought 8.

efa1e6e5-9e99-4e24-ac53-56e41ea2d829
24, 48, 72, 96 I'll jump in and start the analysis


Don't start.

The analysis is not then, that's

just I'll give you a couple

minutes to see if you can figure

out what you need to do. And

then I'll. I'll interject. OK, no

problem. OK, so we didn't start

aa83bc58-56fe-4034-9cbb-063e9e083190

the analysis we'll go back.

OK, add files are done that

ad096146-a996-455d-976e-778b5b4e8c50

next. I want to extract files.

c86c382a-f17d-4103-9b54-63952d05c76e

Review details.

Ok, I'm just checking

the details are correct. OK, so

There seems to be a change in in

in adducts for that first

one. So if I go back.

bff8fc8b-a769-44af-91d0-117534e8c026

Keep going back again.

Just to see what's happened

here. For some reason the PC 34

two is now no longer an M + formate. It is an M plus fact that

yeah it should be.That's very strange,

OK? I got the right ones 34 and

going to review things and they

are definitely the right ones.

e6383787-584e-432b-aa1e-0aac6f5f8401

So why is that no longer coming

up with negative ion type adducts

I'll flip to pos and I'll flip to neg, see what it gives me.

d9b0bc02-f736-4185-a0e3-71a99b8995e8

OK so flip that back. OK reset,

I'm just going to check the

details against 34 two make sure

I got the right.

Formulae that looks fine, 586

tolerance. I think that it

d5bfd00a-66e4-44e9-a0c3-240d1be5c2ae

should be 2 I'll bring that up.

e343ad5d-abbd-475b-bf8e-4f698774b690

Tolerance 20 that's fine and I'm

going to do this. This is the M

d9557d45-a626-4743-bf15-4f4b75405813

like and that was 36. One that

bb18901f-5c12-4382-9365-a92e6c1c7798

should be. I'm sodium, I said

that four 680 tolerance.

This was M-H, 3, 654.

as far as I can tell. So next I

put him and put in the hours, the time points.





so I'll I'll

interject here. OK, and if you

look at the top left the window

fc53526d-cc31-42e4-92ac-d3f2470491f3

you'll see the file menu.






Oh sorry, I didn't

see that. OK, yeah.

b8076812-9bbd-457f-a4f6-ad835fd3bf6d

Yep OK, so export lipids presumably.

d67ea6a9-e29a-4f35-a5b1-c93a399970da

OK filename. OK so I'm given

a dialog with the file name. I'll

just give you I don't know. I'll

call it PW test.

OK, and presumably

I need to save that.

a0af591f-7106-44a5-9133-1fe24f00d090

OK, where is that saved to

looking to see if that's been

saved anywhere on my desktop?

Or is it just sitting within

the software?

b2eb8032-f18e-4dd7-89d7-04e646c29ffd

Can't seem to.

e4fbabc9-834f-421f-bb1e-3790834070ce

Don't seem to know where that's

gone now so I can go file.





Well, so that's the second

task complete. 

The third task, if you go back to the

first menu and delete all the


lipids that you just entered.

So just back. Yeah, back back.

b7edc62b-5aff-44d7-9856-3d94011ac2cf

Delete that, delete those.

Yeah remove, remove yeah and





so the third task is

Import lipids from task two and

perform the analysis on those

lipids. OK, so OK, so got a 

dialog box in import lipids. So I've got a file.

I've got a drop down menu with

d45075ff-5798-4607-9a0b-b920d40f9962

add new adducrtt export lipids,

import lipids or just quit. So

c7108c2d-48ed-4458-9d7b-ec44390f2adc

being asked to import lipids. So

I want to do this form the

positive. I suppose I could do

that. Well, just did it for the

f389636b-8e31-4547-82ca-c757ef2b5f04

negative ion so I'll do those

ones to import lipids from

there. Choose file. OK, OK, so

the PW test.

open that

OK. OK, so then comes up so it's

import and that's relatively

well it's very straightforward

to just import that so PC 34

again do seem to be getting some

a85dad98-0d01-4c8c-a175-d475965ef823

changes in terms of the

information is being inputted or

input into these dialog boxes

here and in terms of adduct type

and isotope depth. But nonetheless

it was very, very

straightforward to import those

files, and then I presume I

a5e0ee95-2263-46d9-82cb-66d6094a97e5

could just go to again what I

will do is I'll just make this

change. 
<BUG IDENTIFICATION>

Just perform performance

analysis and I've done that

next. That's fine. Gonna

start the analysis.

e5be2610-3cc2-4af6-b327-e22e1a934da5

And it's running through.

<BUG IDENTIFICATION

And the 4th and final task.

is define a new

positive adduct that is not in

the list of positive adducts.

Example of this would be M + H - H20 the the values for the

calculation don't need to be

correct. 


OK, So what I'm going

to do? OK so I've been asked to

input a new adduct type so once

e572c9a4-4402-4727-bc29-3f96f6e2bd44

in this I'm just going to just

just for ease I'm going to go to

db1f5337-6a02-4fab-9789-118322d38ca7

conditions and I'm just going

to put in one of the lipids we've got

Appreciate this may not be the

correct adduct, but it's really

just part of the task. So I've

e1680a6d-287c-471d-aabb-e28af665998e

got lipid formula paste. OK, so

adduct type I haven't got them.

that I notice on the file menu

that you could add a new

adduct, so I want to do that.

So we'll call adduct formula. I

think if we can do that will

say M minus water.

db6d8021-be6d-440d-a421-364f72ecd832

OK, and we'll say that's

positive. OK That's addition value.

I'm just trying to think what

that would be like would

presumably be. I don't have to

talk about how can probably find

it out, but I don't know what

the accurate mass for for water

d2b11fbb-49f3-406f-9114-ca6890a63b1f

is off the top of my head would

be 18.0901023 or something like

afea4a62-0533-42d2-aeb1-bb6938c4a239

that. I've got adduct

multiplication value I don't

quite know what that means, but

I'm going to say we'll call it

f9fd3cf7-8536-4c10-b22e-e0a5cd19c24a

one. I don't think

there will be any more that

fa52f326-7355-4849-9b68-2f8b50dde0b8

would almost certainly be singly

charged anyway. M minus

water plus plus H actually mean that's better.

That's more like that's more

accurate. OK, sorry, can't I'm

added nickname optional. I

probably wouldn't use a nickname

for it. I would probably just

stick to the type and then what

I'm going to do is I'm just

going to submit that.

And I'm going to see if that has

gone into the adduct type box.

Doesn't seem to have OK, so.

Not input that correctly, so

I'll give it another go to

file, add new adduct


<BUG IDENTIFICATION>

Ah great, it's in there now

just for the

c0f38619-a7b5-4d1f-bced-a7bd7cb93cda

purpose of exercise I'm having

restarted the program. I've now

gone to the enter lipid

information on dialog box and I

can now see that the product I

want to import is now in all the

information I probably input in,

correct that that would be

correct. Should I input it

again? But clearly from file and

drop down menu list I'm able to

add. Our new adducts export,

import lipids and obviously

quit. Presumably the program. So
