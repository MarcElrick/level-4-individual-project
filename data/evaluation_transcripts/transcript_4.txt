The first task is performing analysis on three lipids from


positive data set.

So the three lipids  are PC 34:1, PC 34:2, PC 36:2, so I

presume I go to lipid name

and put in PC space 34 one.


Lipid formula, I'll copy that

over from the spreadsheet. I'm

not typing that out


Okay, its an M+H adduct so 

I don't need to select

anything. An isotope Depth?

OK, that's six. I can see that

on the screen, so I'm just going

to click up to get the six.


Retention time is 660 seconds, I

presume, so I'm just going to


type 660 into that box.

The retention time tolerance is 20,

Mass tolerance, so there's

PPM box and the Dalton box,


so I'm just going to put it

in as a 5PPM.

And then click on add lipid

and then I can scroll down and

put the next one in.


Put PC 34:2 and copy over the lipid formula


Put that in.

Isotope depth is 6, retention time is 600.

Tolerance again is 20.


Mass tolrance is 5.


And then add lipid.

Okay and the final one

PC 36:2.

I'll put the formula in.

M + H again, isotope depth, 6


I don't know what isotope depth is but I presume its the number of...have I figured on formula in for the previous one?

Should be that one.

OK.


I'll put that one in for 34:2.

This is nothing to do with the software its

just me being stupid.



Retention time for that

one is 638.

tolerance is 20


Type in 5PPM.


That's them all in and then I can

click on next.


Step two, pick files and

enter times. 

So I'm going to click on the add files button and that's

taking me.


To a folder and I will click up.


And click on to

positive  evaluation.


And there's five files there, so

presumably pick all of them


because it's a time course.


I'm gonna open those up.

OK, first one file 0 I'm presuming I'm gonna put in time 0 for that next one

next one file 8 and put in 8. I'm 

presuming that's  the number of

hours next one I'll put in 48, next

one I'll put in 72 and then I'll put


in 96. I'm gonnaadd files.


Oh no, I'm not cancel return that I'm

gonna do next.

Now a screen has come up,

Step 3, review analysis


details. It's got three lipids.

I hope it's not the right

formulas in. Adduct, isotope depth, retention time.

The mass and then it's got

the files and then I'm gonna

click on start analysis and hope for the best.

Test so it's analyzing the

various time points.

It's on 34:1...34:2...36:2

writing to outputs. And I'm

getting very excited now.




<OUTPUT BUG ENCOUNTERED>



There we go. That's

it started up begin.


Ask if you need any further

elaboration on this one.

Define any three negative

lipids and export them, and

this does not involve running

the analysis. You are defining

the three lipids and exporting

the definitions so that you can

import the definitions later and

you don't have to enter them.





Okay.

So I'm in negative ion mode.

Sorry, what was I supposed to

do? Didn't understand that.




So the first part is

define three negative lipids.

Export them so that those those

lipids can be saved and then

you can import that later and

you don't have to type them again.




Okay so I want to

PC 34:2, type that in, I'm gonna put the formula in.

this time its formate adduct so

I'm going to change the adduct

type. Isotope depth this time is 2

retention time I'm gonna put in 586. tolerance is 20.

PPM tolerance is 5,

so I'm adding that lipid.


Then I'm going to put in the next one. PC 36:1

Formula. This time we've got a sodium

adduct so I'm gonna select


that one. Isotope depth is 4

retention time is 680.


Tolerance is 20.

and mass tolerance is 5

Lipid name PE 37:1, copy that over

M+H that's fine, Isotope depth is 3
retention time is 654
Tolerance 20 and 5 so add lipid

So I'm gonna go to file.


And export lipids 

filename so I'm gonna put that as PC PE neg

And I'm gonna save that.


And then presumably, if I

remove the lipids and can import the file






I'll stop there for a second, just because that's the second task complete.

The third task is import lipids from task 2 and perform analysis on them.







So I.

I'm going to file import

lipids and choose a file. I

have found the file is under

main, saved runs.

Open that up.


I'm going to import.

I'm going to just check

that they're all there.

OK, so this 123 is waiting for

one there, so I'm just going to

remove that lipid.


So I've got three lipids negative ion, everything's OK.

I want to click on next, I can't so I'll go on file

But it won't let me do that.



<BUG IDENTIFICATION - NEXT BUTTON REMAINING INACTIVE FOR VALID LIPID>

And then click on next.

Add files.

Going into next evaluation and

aI'm gonna add all the files again, I'm gonna put



the times on.

8, 24, 48. 72, 96


Add Files. Oh no, I got that one wrong again.


Then click on next.

Start analysis.

And then it just got to the

writing to output bit again.

<BUG IDENTIFICATION>

Task 4 define a new positive

adduct that is not on the

list of positive adults.


An example of this would be

M + H - H2O

the add and multiplication values for the

calculation don't need to be

correct. OK, so I'm gonna go to

file at the top left and add new

adduct, adduct, formula and type

in M + H - H2O

That's not right, what is it?



And that's going to be negative

Adduct addition value is going to be M + H - water

it's gonna be a minus.


Minus 17, adduct multiplication value.

No idea really, I'll put that as 1.

Adduct nickname which

is, I've probably got that

wrong at the top then.

I suspect this is going to fail, I'm going to click on submit.

Oh, its done it and then.


Yeah.


It's there, I don't think it's

right but its there.
