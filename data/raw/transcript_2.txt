E: So the first task is to perform analysis on three lipids from the positive data set using the lipids provided.

P: OK.

E:
Yeah, if you can, just try and verbalize what you're doing and just thinkaloud.


P: I'm choosing the top lipid, I've entered the name and now I'll enter the formula.

And its the M+H adduct and then... isotope depth 6,

Retention time 660, tolerance 20, and 5 PPM.

So just double check.

And then... so it's three so I might add a lipid and see if I can do them all at once.

<LOST AUDIO AT THIS POINT FOR A FEW SECONDS>

tolerance of 20, 5ppm.

And then I'll add the last one:

So PC 36:2, C44H84NO8P.

Positive with isotope depth of six, retention time of 638

tolerances 20 and 5 PPM.

Then I'll click next.

Add the files, so I saved them on my desktop under conditions pos.

So open.

I'll see if I can add them all at once.

Yep, okay. So that this time 0, that's fine. This one I set to 8.

That one's 48, this ones 72 and this one 96.

I'll double check then click next.

OK, so review analysis details.

So just checking... I've not made any mistakes.

OK, so start the analysis.

OK.


E:
So task 2: Define any three negative lipids and export them.
And when I say export them, you've not to perform the analysis so you have to export them so they can be imported later.


P:
OK.
I'm guessing that means put in the data and then save that input. 

E:
Yeah.

P:
OK.
So.
I'll put in the lipid name.

And then the formula.

And then that's the fomate adduct.

Isotope depth is 2.

Retention time of 586.

Add lipid.

The second one is PC 36:1

So C44H86N08P.

The sodium adduct,.

Isotope depth 4.

Retention time 680.

tolerance 20 and 5 PPM.


Add lipid.



PE 37:1

C42H82N08P

Negative ion, isotope depth of 3.

Retention time is 654

So I'll see if I can save it from here.

Export lipids.

And then I'll save this as negative.


<AUDIO LOST BRIEFLY, RUN SUCCESSFULLY SAVED>




E: 
That is task 2 complete. Now the third task.

Import the lipids from task two an, perform the analysis and those lipids.




P:
OK.

Import lipids.

Choose file

Okay, import.





E:
I think we have actually found a bug. And yeah, I don't take this

is positive, but that's fine. We can just move on just ignore it.
<BUG IDENTIFIED?



P:

So I'll just analyse it and obviously the output

for this one isn't going to be correct because

the adducts aren't but...




E: 
That's fine.

And then is there.

OK, Yep.

So the 4th and final task...

Define a new positive

adduct. An example of this would be [M + H - H20] too.

The add and multiplication values for the calculation don't need to be correct.






P:

File... add new adduct.

erm.

Yeah, I might do the one you said.

Does it need spaces?


E:

Well I'll let

you figure it out.



P:

So the addition value.


E:

Again, it doesn't need to

be correct.




P:
Adduct multiplication value.


So I think I'll use one.

And I won't have a nickname.




E:

The second part to this task is just define a

lipid with that adduct, the rest of the information doesn't need to be correct. 



P: 
OK, 

<PARTICIPANT SELECTS NEW LIPID, APPLICATION CRASHES>



So that's us was done. I'll stop recording now.
