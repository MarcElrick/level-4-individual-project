E: First task is

Perform analysis on three lipids from the positive 

data set and then if using the reduced  dataset, use the

provided lipids and the

provided conditions.



P:
OK, so OK. So I've come to a dialog box on screen about lipid 

name, lipid formula, adduct type

type i'm going to look at the

drop down. With that there's there's protonated ammonium adduct

,sodium adduct potassium adduct. 

Further, for the future, maybe

there may be other adducts that

you might we might want to add

in positive, but then they are

the major ones. I would argue for positive ion. 

Isotope depth, 

not quite sure what that is. Retention time tolerance, mass to charge

charge, PPM tolerance there remove lipid. So do I just

need to know now presumably just need to type in or to


extract lipid name from the file

you provided. Yep.


So I can just type one in.

Yep. OK.

OK, let's see how that works.


Although maybe I'll do an


abbreviation, Say 34:1. See what happens there? OK

liquid formula off the top my

head. I don't know it.

If you go into their conditions file. 
 
My apologies, OK, right? 


That's fine. That's no

problem. OK, sorry.

That was a good one. Wasn't it OK. 

Again, just in terms of

notification, it would be

useful just to say to to use

is what, what notation you

want the lipid name. Some

people might put in a full

name, for example ...

 Again depends on notation, so it's 

 it's quite a nice thing to have OK adduct type M+H

 isotope depth, okay I have all the conditions here. My apologies 

 alright, that's all straightforward enough. 

 Type that in six, retention time 660, so we've done it in terms 

of seconds. OK, that's fine.

Often often work in minutes

myself, but that's fine. You

know it's easy enough to divide

by 60 became, so got an accurate

mass tolerance should be five.

OK. Then add lipid presumably.

OK, just put these OK. Just put all these in. OK so 

I'll just put time. Now I'm

just putting in the remaining


lipids that have been chosen,

or at least provided in the

condition. So again lipid

formula. I'll just copy that.

 Again that's an M+H

Isotope okay that's easy enough 6.

retention Time is 600 in this 

case.

Tolerance is 20. Did I mess that up?

The mass again, tolerance was PPM, so again, 

it's nice. You got tolerance

both PPM in Dalton. I generally

work in PPM, but I know some

people [refer dalton] and OK and

I'll. Add a third lipid.

So again, lipid name again from

the conditions provided 36.

Lipid formula will copy that.

Make a straightforward enough and M plus H again isotope depth

this 6. Retention time on this

occasion 638. Tolerance

again 20 so OK

and then PPM.

Five OK, and then I'll

presumably now I've got my

three lipids in positive. I'm

just gonna go back and double

check them all. OK charge mode there so it's clear 

their lipid name, Formula, adduct. Okay isotope 

depth, retension time mass tolerance and mass charge 

and its tolerance. accurate mass another 34:1 34:2. OK, I 

isotope depth I've entered the wrong values so that would help 6 


retention time 600 tolerance should be 

20, is that right? Yeah, OK, that's fine, and I don't know why I've got 34 in

there. OK, that's OK. Isotope depth. Something seems to be changing when I'm putting

stuff in there, so I'm not quite sure what's


happening there when I'm changing those conditions. So 

I'm putting numbers in and this

number seems to be changing so

that what that is. But but

maybe, just maybe, do being

doing something silly again.

Likewise, that seems to do the

same in terms of isotope depth.

If I go up.

Can I just do that? that seems fineso I need to use it if I go

that down. Six retention time

can needs to be.

600 and a tolerance of 20

OK 660. Yeah, that's fine. I'll go next. 

Pick files and enter and add files, presuming that 

I'll just need to go and add

files from the files that

being provided from the folder I have got. So if I go

to my desktop and I've got

positive evaluation, so I'm

assuming that I had all of

these files, so I wonder if

I can select more, so that's

why I'm going to try and do.

OK, and then I got out the

files. Cancel don't need

to do that. OK, right? And we

got here. Pick files into times.

OK, so I'm slightly not quite

sure what I need to do here. So

in terms of picking times.

So I'm not, I'm yeah OK.

So I did my files, pick files

and enter times. Start

lookign in the conditions. If

I can find anything in terms

of entering times doesn't seem

to be. I don't have entry

times means the time that I

just give it a value or just

see what happens there.

What does that refer to

retention time?

Look

OK, so I've now filled in those

times. In fact, maybe why

didn't? Why did I call them?

Actually, I know what I'll

do is. I'll call him the time

points for the experiments of

the experiment so well say nought, 8.

48, 72, 96 We'll just see how we go with that. So I've

filled in those boxes. I'm not

sure if I've filled them in correctly, but I have

filled them in so I'll go to

next and we'll see where we go.

OK, review analysis details

lipids, files Okay . So that previous. So if I

go back yeah OK what we really

for me be really handy is again

just to give an indication as to

the time points. Again as someone whos not a bioinformatics specialist.

and not necessarily good with softwarethat would be really

good just to offer some some

guides there to make it very

clear for people who are not as

experts is maybe other users. So

go to next, Ilike the feature

I can go back. That's really

good and review things.

OK, got the files. OK I've got

review analysis details and

lipids. Yeah OK, that's fine.

It seems to be seems to be some

slight changes here in terms of

mass tolerance. Not quite sure

why that is and again some

retention times that if I've

done something strange. But

let's start the analysis

anyway. We can always go back

and have a play. Start the

analysis so performing

analysis.

Different time points, so this

is the first PC 34 one. Now this

is the second PC 34:2.

PC-36. Two

to the third lipid again.

Again three lipids

chosen from positive ion.


OK just waiting for this analysis to complete.

<BUG IDENTIFICATION>


E:
And so the next task is define any three negative lipids and

export them. And by exporting

them, I mean you should export

them so that you can import

them again later.



P:
OK, I'm gonna I'm OK. So if I

don't need to use that box and

I'm not, I won't. OK so I'm not

quite sure as to the task in

terms of I can extract the ions

from the from the raw files or

if you have the. In this case

we've got the mzxml

or MZML files so I can. I

can try and open those and I can

look for the accurate masses of

these particular PCs.



E:
I'll give you a little bit

of assistance here. I am, so

the first thing you

need to do is enter the lipids

as you did before. 

OK, I'll

let you see if you can figure

out what to do after

that. 



P:

Let's just do that then so

I'll do all three. So this is

this is negative. ion now just.

Completing the details as per

the so again that's different.

If an adduct and M minus formate

M plus formate even isotope

depth should be 2.

Retention time is 586.

Tolerance is 20.

Mass we've already got, PPM

should be 5

And I had a lipid.

And this is PC 36:1.

Lipid formula, I'll

just copy it.

Okay isotope depth is 4

retention time is 680. Sorry not

talking enough so I'm just

completing the. The important

information and putting that in

at 5 PPM.

And he's got a third lipid

negative ion lipid. Name will be

PC 37 one.

Lipid formula is that

OK M - H thats fine. isotope depth is three

retention time is 654

tolerance is, 20 mass to charge

tolerances 5 again as with

positive, I'm just going to

check the data and make sure

it's inputted correctly. 
Isotope depth is five.

That's fine.

That's four, six, 18,20 that's all

very good. That's 36:1 ninety

five and then P 37 one.

M-H, tolerance, 3654

twenty. You know. Just making

sure. OK, that's

fine. So I'm going to next.

OK, so pick files and enter

times again. So again, if I add

files again from negative ion on

this occasion, so I'm just going

to Add all of those files.

Again, I will use the different

time points for the data

collection, so that looks like

it's against its in terms of

hours of labeling nought 8.

24, 48, 72, 96 I'll jump in and start the analysis



E:

Don't start.

The analysis is not then, that's

just I'll give you a couple

minutes to see if you can figure

out what you need to do. And

then I'll. I'll interject. 



P:
OK, no

problem. OK, so we didn't start

the analysis we'll go back.

OK, add files are done that

next. I want to extract files.

Review details.

Ok, I'm just checking

the details are correct. OK, so

There seems to be a change in in

in adducts for that first

one. So if I go back.

Keep going back again.

Just to see what's happened

here. For some reason the PC 34

two is now no longer an M + formate. It is an M plus fact that

yeah it should be.That's very strange,

OK? I got the right ones 34 and

going to review things and they

are definitely the right ones.

So why is that no longer coming

up with negative ion type adducts

I'll flip to pos and I'll flip to neg, see what it gives me.

OK so flip that back. OK reset,

I'm just going to check the

details against 34 two make sure

I got the right.

Formulae that looks fine, 586

tolerance. I think that it

should be 2 I'll bring that up.

Tolerance 20 that's fine and I'm

going to do this. This is the M

like and that was 36. One that

should be. I'm sodium, I said

that four 680 tolerance.

This was M-H, 3, 654.

as far as I can tell. So next I

put him and put in the hours, the time points.




E:
so I'll I'll

interject here. OK, and if you

look at the top left the window

fc53526d-cc31-42e4-92ac-d3f2470491f3

you'll see the file menu.



P:

Oh sorry, I didn't

see that. OK, yeah.

Yep OK, so export lipids presumably.

OK filename. OK so I'm given

a dialog with the file name. I'll

just give you I don't know. I'll

call it PW test.

OK, and presumably

I need to save that.

OK, where is that saved to

looking to see if that's been

saved anywhere on my desktop?

Or is it just sitting within

the software?

Can't seem to.

Don't seem to know where that's

gone now so I can go file.




E:

So the third task is

Import lipids from task two and

perform the analysis on those

lipids. 





P:
OK, so OK, so got a 

dialog box in import lipids. So I've got a file.

I've got a drop down menu with

add new adducrtt export lipids,

import lipids or just quit. So

being asked to import lipids. So

I want to do this form the

positive. I suppose I could do

that. Well, just did it for the

negative ion so I'll do those

ones to import lipids from

there. Choose file. OK, OK, so

the PW test.

open that

OK. OK, so then comes up so it's

import and that's relatively

well it's very straightforward

to just import that so PC 34

again do seem to be getting some

changes in terms of the

information is being inputted or

input into these dialog boxes

here and in terms of adduct type

and isotope depth. But nonetheless

it was very, very

straightforward to import those

files, and then I presume I

could just go to again what I

will do is I'll just make this

change. 
<BUG IDENTIFICATION>

Just perform performance

analysis and I've done that

next. That's fine. Gonna

start the analysis.

And it's running through.

<BUG IDENTIFICATION

And the 4th and final task.

is define a new

positive adduct that is not in

the list of positive adducts.

Example of this would be M + H - H20 the the values for the

calculation don't need to be

correct. 


OK, So what I'm going

to do? OK so I've been asked to

input a new adduct type so once

in this I'm just going to just

just for ease I'm going to go to

conditions and I'm just going

to put in one of the lipids we've got

Appreciate this may not be the

correct adduct, but it's really

just part of the task. So I've

got lipid formula paste. OK, so

adduct type I haven't got them.

that I notice on the file menu

that you could add a new

adduct, so I want to do that.

So we'll call adduct formula. I

think if we can do that will

say M minus water.

OK, and we'll say that's

positive. OK That's addition value.

I'm just trying to think what

that would be like would

presumably be. I don't have to

talk about how can probably find

it out, but I don't know what

the accurate mass for for water

is off the top of my head would

be 18.0901023 or something like

that. I've got adduct

multiplication value I don't

quite know what that means, but

I'm going to say we'll call it

one. I don't think

there will be any more that

would almost certainly be singly

charged anyway. M minus

water plus plus H actually mean that's better.

That's more like that's more

accurate. OK, sorry, can't I'm

added nickname optional. I

probably wouldn't use a nickname

for it. I would probably just

stick to the type and then what

I'm going to do is I'm just

going to submit that.

And I'm going to see if that has

gone into the adduct type box.

Doesn't seem to have OK, so.

Not input that correctly, so

I'll give it another go to

file, add new adduct


<BUG IDENTIFICATION>

P:

Ah great, it's in there now

just for the purpose of exercise I'm having

restarted the program. I've now

gone to the enter lipid

information on dialog box and I

can now see that the product I

want to import is now in all the

information I probably input in,

correct that that would be

correct. Should I input it

again? But clearly from file and

drop down menu list I'm able to

add. Our new adducts export,

import lipids and obviously

quit. Presumably the program. So

from that perspective it's it's

very intuitive and

straightforward.
