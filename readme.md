# Lipid Isotope Inference Software
This repository contains my Glasgow University Level 4 Individual Project, as well as my dissertation and all related documentation.
## Initial Project Proposal
> "Isotope labelling is a common experimental technique for measuring the activity of a particular chemical pathway. There does not currently exist any easy to use open source software for analysing the resulting data. In collaboration with Glasgow Polyomics and The University of the Highlands and Islands, we have developed a prototype pipeline in Python. In this project, you would work with the clients (wet lab scientists) to turn this prototype into usable software including, for example, standard data input / output and a GUI."
