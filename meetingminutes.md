## 30 Sept 2020
 - (3.5 minutes) Presentation on the basics of isotopic labelling, how it works, with beer brewing example - By using isotopic labelling, we can see how the consumption of different isotopes affects the production of a product we are interested in.
 - (1 minute) Mention of who I will be working with and the motivation behind the project - Dr Phil Whitfield and UHI PHD student, looking to automate isotope labelling process.
 - (2.5 minutes) Discussion re. python prototype and which possible technology stacks we can use to provide a GUI for biologists. Deployed web interface? Java application? interface?
 - (9 minutes) Presenting example of the data that we are dealing with and format of Liquid Chromatography Mass Spectrometry input data that needs to be analysed. Discussion of the entire process from input, to how data is analysed/processed to required output.
 - (2 minutes) Looking at maximum intensity can be easier than peak picking as a strategy, as well as being much faster than peak picking.
 - (1 minute) Discussion of understanding of the entire process and where to find resources - Git repo
 - (2 minutes) Discussed possibility of using university domain to host, as well as packaging a python project, or dockerised web app. Uploading files to a web app could cause delays as input files are large.
 - (1 minutes) Discussion of plan going forward - get to grips with project, email introduction to clients
 - (1 minute) Brief discussion regarding clients/points of contact, and paper describing kinetic curve fitting.

## 6 Oct 2020
 - (1 minute) - discussion of my understanding of the chemistry.
 - (8 minutes) - discussion of my understanding of the software process behind extracting data.
 - (3 minutes) - outline of my development plan going forward.
 - (2.5 minutes) - outline technology choices.
 - (2 minutes) - discussion of libraries that I found in protoptype pipeline and whether or not they are needed.
 - (1.5 minutes) - discussion of the aims of the experiments and what scientists are interested in(key point - manipulating charges is done by either adding a proton/removing an electron)
 - (3 minues) - discussion surrounding newly available data files.
 - (3 minutes) - discussion of changes that are required in prototype pipeline.
 - (3 minutes) - Plan going forward: Complete tasks for week 3 in project plan, organise meeting with Phil and Nicole for some time next week.
